    "## Lecture information\n",
    "\n",
    "All lectures will be conducted in class from 4:30pm - 7:00 pm on Thursday.  There will not be any virtual lectures.  The lectures will not be recorded either.  Lecture notes will be posted to Canvas after each lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course description and objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "This course will provide an introduction to dimension-reduction techniques and reduced order modeling.  The course covers the mathematical foundation of all the techniques discussed and includes a diverse set of applications.  In particular, the course covers the utility of dimension reduction in the diagnostics of complex data, deterministic and stochastic reduced order modeling and their applications in optimization and uncertainty quantification.\n",
